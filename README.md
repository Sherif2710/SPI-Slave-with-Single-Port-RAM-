# SPI-Slave-with-Single-Port-RAM-
This module implements an SPI Slave interface integrated with a Single-Port RAM for efficient serial communication and local data storage. Designed in Verilog, it allows seamless data exchange between a master SPI device and internal memory, commonly used in embedded systems and SoC communication frameworks.
